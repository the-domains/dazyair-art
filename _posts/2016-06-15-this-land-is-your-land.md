title: This Land is your land.
description: >-
  Part of a series of graphic work I started when i was visiting home. It
  started with my mom and her husband (ED Lucina 1956-2012) on a trip home to
  Great Falls Montana just after the 100 year celebration. 100 Buffalo lined the
  streets of Great Falls during the celebration and now they are scattered
  around the town. I was inspired so I grabbed my camera and we went on a
  Buffalo hunt.
